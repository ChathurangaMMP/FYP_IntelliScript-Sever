Executive Summary  
 
• The balance of opinion on the business outlook continued to 
remain in the negative territory for the 10th consecutive quarter 
during Q2 2019 mainly due to the setback emanating from the 
Easter Sunday attacks, and even though a slight improvement is 
observed, it is expected to remain negative in Q3 2019 as well, 
with the prevailing uncertain environment in the country.  
• The demand indicator reflected that all three major activities 
slowed down during Q2 2019. Meanwhile, demand for Industry 
and Services related activities are expected to improve during Q3 
2019. 
• Respondents intend to recruit employees mainly to fill vacant 
positions. Further, capacity utilization of the firms are expected 
to improve in Q3 2019 and investments are expected to increase 
in Q3 2019. 
• The output and input prices are expected to increase at a slower 
rate in Q3 2019 compared to Q3 2018. 
• The demand for bank credit increased during Q2 2019 especially 
in the context of deteriorated cash flow situation, although access 
to credit tightened. Meanwhile, majority of the firms expect to 
borrow during Q3 2019 to cover the operational expenses.
