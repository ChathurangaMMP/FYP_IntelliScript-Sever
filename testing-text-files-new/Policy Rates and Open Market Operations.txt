 
Monetary Policy Instruments and Implementation
The Central Bank possesses a wide range of tools to be used as instruments of monetary policy. At present, the monetary policy places greater rel
market based policy instruments. As a consequence, the main monetary policy instruments currently used are policy interest rates, Open Market Op
(OMO) and the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) on commercial bank deposit liabilities. The first step in the monetary policy implementation is 
forecasting. (Click here for the details)
 
Policy Interest Rates and Open Market Operations (OMO)
At present, the Central Bank conducts its monetary policy under a system of active OMOs. The key elements of the system are (i) an interest rate 
formed by the main policy rates of the Bank i.e. Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR), and (ii) Open
Operations. 
1. The main instruments to achieve the intended inflation path are the SDFR (formerly the repurchase rate) and the SLFR (formerly the reverse repurcha
of the Central Bank which form the lower and upper bounds for the overnight interest rates in money markets. These rates, which are the Bank's main
signalling mechanism on its monetary policy stance, are reviewed on a regular basis, usually eight times per year, and revised if necessary.
2. Standing facilities are available for those participating financial institutions which were unable to obtain their liquidity requirements at the daily auctio
is, even after an auction, if a participant has excess money it could deposit such funds under the standing deposit facility. Similarly, if a participant n
liquidity to cover a shortage, it could borrow funds on a reverse repurchase basis under the standing lending facility. Accordingly, these facilities help
wide fluctuations in overnight interest rates.
3. OMOs are conducted either to absorb liquidity if there is excess liquidity, or to inject liquidity if there is a shortage of liquidity, thereby maintaining sta
overnight interest rates. OMOs are conducted through auctions to buy /sell government securities on a permanent or a temporary basis (Click here fo
detailed description of the process of conducting OMO). The auction is on a multiple bid, multiple price system. Participants in the money market cou
make up to three bids at each short-term auction and up to six bids at each long-term auction and the successful bidders would receive their request
rates quoted in the relevant bid.
 
Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR)
The Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) is the proportion of deposit liabilities that the Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) are required to keep as
deposit with the Central Bank. Under the Monetary Law Act (MLA), LCBs are required to maintain reserves with the Central Bank at rates determined by t
At present, demand, time and savings deposits of LCBs denominated in rupee terms are subject to the SRR.
The SRR has been widely used to influence the money supply in the past. However, the reliance on SRR as a regular monetary management measure h
gradually reduced with a view to enhancing market orientation of monetary policy and also reducing the implicit cost of funds which the SRR would e
LCBs. Therefore, at present, the Central Bank uses the SRR to address persistent liquidity issues in the market (Click here for details on how SRR is comp
 
Other Policy Instruments
In addition, depending on the need and circumstances in the economy, the Central Bank can use quantitative restrictions on credit, ceilings on interest rat
suasion as well as communication and forward guidance for the purpose of monetary management.
