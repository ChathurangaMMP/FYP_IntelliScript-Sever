Condominium Market 1  
3rd Quarter of 2021 
 
 
Condominium Sales  
 
An increase was observed in the reported condominium sales transactions during 
Q3, 2021 compared to the corresponding period of the previous year and also 
compared to the previous quarter, as indicated by the Condominium Property 
Volume Index2. Even though, the most preferred condominium units were in the 
single condominium project category and those of below Rs.25 million, a gradual 
increase could be observed in sales of condominiums priced between Rs. 25 to 50 
million. By the end of Q3, 2021, majority of the units (96 per cent) in completed 
condominium projects have been sold. Meanwhile, in ongoing condominium 
projects, 58 per cent and 55 per cent of units have been reserved in single 
condominium projects and mixed development projects, respectively.  
 
 
Pre-sale deposits, bank loans and equity were the three key funding sources for 
condominium developments. It could be observed that the proportions of pre-sale 
deposits have increased during Q3, 2021 compared to the previous quarter. The 
proportions were calculated to get an overall understanding about the funding structure of 
condominium developments by averaging the percentages of funds received through 
different funding sources provided by each developer.
