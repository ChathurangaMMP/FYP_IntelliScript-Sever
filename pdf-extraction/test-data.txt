Centre for Banking Studies

Centre for Banking Studies (CBS) has been
contributing to enrich the capacity of the Sri Lankan
financial sector for over four decades since its
inception. As the human capital development arm
of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), we have
been catering to the evolving needs of the financial
sector and has been guiding many to achieve their
career aspirations by equipping them with frontier
skills and expert knowledge required to tackle both
ongoing and upcoming challenges.

This year too, CBS has introduced many new training
interventions for the financial industry to address
novel and emerging areas which are high on demand
while improving existing programmes further to be
in par with the current necessities. Therefore, CBS is

well prepared to assist financial institutions not only
in Sri Lanka but also across the region in their efforts
to strengthen the capacity of human resources.

CBS not only provides training, but also creates
opportunities for participants to be benefitted
through fruitful interactions with peers while sharing
professional experiences with each other, so that the
synergetic effects also can be realized.

Altogether, grooming professionals with right
knowledge and skills for the finance industry remains
at the heart of CBS’ agenda and we sincerely believe
investing on that will chart a stable and prosperous
path forward.

Governor's Message

Continuous advancement of technology, versality of

international best practices and evolving customer
expectations are changing the financial industry
landscape at a rapid pace. Developments stemmed
by various factors including fintech innovations,
sustainability concerns and usage of big data pose

a challenging environment for the industry.

Undoubtedly, these developments create new

opportunities for financial institutions and
markets, so they can offer innovative products
and services for their customers. On the contrary,
there could be various risk elements arising due to
these developments, as well. Therefore, financial
institutions need to strike a balance between these

two dimensions in a precautionary way.

In doing so, financial institutions need to
continuously invest in their human capital and
skill them to stay abreast with or go further than
these developments. When it comes to Sri Lankan
context, ongoing economic crisis has made the

talent management more challenging.

Therefore, with the intention of assisting financial
institutions to face the challenging times ahead,
the Centre for Banking Studies (CBS) has taken the
initiative to offer diverse set of programmes for the
year 2023 to meet these new demands and fill the

skill gaps in the financial sector.

In addition to training interventions of CBS, | was
able to witness a variety of new initiatives such as
High-Level Seminars and Expert Panel Discussions
organized by CBS, that create rich platforms to
discuss timely topics with different perspectives

and bring in new knowledge to the country.

Hence, | would like to make this an opportunity to
invite all of you to take part in these training and
events organized by CBS, and be equipped with
the latest knowledge, with which we can take our

financial industry and the country forward.

Director's Message

The year 2023 will dawn with fresh hopes for the

recovery of SriLankan economy which had to withstand
a very turbulent time in the recent past. While accepting
the fact that the adversity is here to stay for a while, all
of us must explore out of the box solutions to tackle

the obstacles by being both adaptive and innovative.

In this challenging journey towards the economic
revival, the financial sector of the country is expected
to play a key role in fuelling the growth engine of
the country. However, it is notable that the financial
sector itself should deal with numerous challenges on

different fronts at the moment.

Changes taking place in the global landscape demands
the Sri Lankan financial sector to be more tech
savvy, innovative and prudent. This means financial

institutions must make a serious consideration to

address learning needs of employees in formulating
corporate strategies. Given the advancements of
Information and Communications Technologies (ICT)
finance professionals must engage in a continuous
learning process to ensure that they stay updated. On
the other front, there is immense pressure on financial
institutions with the apparent trend of draining human

capital due to the prevailing situation in the country.

At the same time, the economic crisis demands
rigorous and drastic policy actions to be introduced
and implemented within the country. In the process
of effective implementation of these policies, it is
essential to ensure that all stakeholders are kept well

informed with right amount of awareness.

Therefore, as a professional financial education service
provider, Centre for Banking Studies is committed and
well prepared to equip the financial sector to gain
strategic advantage by nurturing the human resources
to counter unavoidable challenges, and to create
awareness among public on contemporary economic

issues, in the year 2023 as well.

We invite all of you to keep yourself connected with
Centre for Banking Studies, so we can assist your

journey towards a knowledge and skill-rich future.

“According to the Monetary Law Act, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is the sole authority of issuing
currency notes and coins in Sri Lanka. The presence of counterfeit currency is a threat to this authority
and to the effective functioning of the monetary system. Any type of involvement in producing and
distributing counterfeit currency is an offence, under criminal law. Presence of counterfeit currency
exposes those who handle currency to a higher level of risk. Therefore, it is imperative that all officers
who handle currency notes in banks and other financial institutions be knowledgeable on the security
features of currency notes enabling them to identify counterfeits.”

cash handling, identification of genuine currency notes, legal aspects and the procedures of handling
